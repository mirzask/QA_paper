## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Ensuring good quality of medical images (e.g., computed tomography, CT) is essential for achieve maximum diagnostic information and image interpretation. While in practice, medical imaging can be destroyed by many factors such as system error at data acquisition and network transferring. Multiple existed tools are developed to deal with medical imaging, while most of them are either fail to handle multiple errors may encounter or provide comprehensive quality assessment (QA) report. In this paper, we develop a whole pipeline with several open source applications to assess the quality of CT images from the original DICOM file, and convert to 3D NIFTI files. Seven possible steps are checked to make sure the medical images are appropriate for next steps (diagnostic usage or machine learning). Our QA tool has been proved to be useful and time-saving for clinical laboratory usage and processing data for image interpretation.
