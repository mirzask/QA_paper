## Introduction {.page_break_before}

The primary use case for medical imaging is for interpretation by radiologists and other trained persons. Secondary use of medical imaging for research and discovery has become more prominent and has led to many meaningful contributions to imaging and medicine. 

Often, analyses relying on medical imaging utilize the raw Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) image files or other common image file formats, such as nrrd or NIfTI. In medical image de-identification, minor encoding errors or manipulation of DICOM file data could render these files useless or inaccessible [**citation**]. On a similar note, adjustments/modifications to image files, such as those used to aid a radiologists' view, may pose challenges for image modeling tasks. Yet, ~~there remains little consensus or tools providing a pipeline~~ little attention has been afforded to ensure the quality of medical image files prior to use in model training ~~to be used in downstream analyses~~.

Data quality is often an under-appreciated but vital component for machine learning tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision. This is often described by the adage, "garbage in, garbage out." In order to address this matter for our own model development, we have developed a series of sensible, automated data quality checks for medical imaging data.

Here we present our tool to assist with quality assessment of medical image files... We demonstrate its use on NLST and x other imaging studies... (some NLST image files are of poor quality; how does this affect model performance?). Demonstrate improved performance of downstream learning tasks by using satisfactory images for training.
